##Clear Microsoft Teams Cache with PowerShell
Overview
This PowerShell script clears the cache for the Microsoft Teams desktop application on Windows. Clearing the cache can help resolve common issues such as:

Performance issues (e.g., slow response, lag)
Sign-in problems
Unexpected behavior in chats or settings
By running this script, you can refresh Teams without needing a full reinstall.

How It Works
The script performs the following actions:

Stops the Microsoft Teams application if itâ€™s running.
Deletes cache files from specific directories within the Teams app data folder.
Optionally, restarts the Teams application after clearing the cache.
PowerShell Script
powershell
Copy code
# Stop Microsoft Teams
Get-Process Teams -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# Define Teams cache location
$TeamsCachePath = "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Teams"

# List of directories within Teams cache that you may want to clear
$foldersToClear = @(
    "\Application Cache\Cache",
    "\Blob_storage",
    "\Cache",
    "\databases",
    "\GPUCache",
    "\IndexedDB",
    "\Local Storage",
    "\tmp"
)

# Remove cache folders
foreach ($folder in $foldersToClear) {
    $fullPath = "$TeamsCachePath$folder"
    if (Test-Path $fullPath) {
        Remove-Item -Path $fullPath -Recurse -Force
    }
}

# Optionally, restart Microsoft Teams
Start-Process "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Teams\Update.exe" --processStart "Teams.exe"
How to Use the Script
Save this code as Clear-TeamsCache.ps1.
Open PowerShell as an administrator.
Run the script by navigating to its location and executing it, e.g., .\Clear-TeamsCache.ps1.
Requirements
No additional modules are needed. The script uses only built-in PowerShell cmdlets.
Important Notes
Save Work in Teams: The script will stop the Teams application, so ensure any unsaved work is completed before running it.
Temporary Sign-Out: Deleting cache files may sign you out of Teams, so be prepared to log in again.
